# Experiments on Neural Networks

This repository documents my experiments involving neural networks.

## Neural Network for Regression from Scratch

I constructed a neural network for (linear) regression to noisy, synthetic data using only Numpy because I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the mathematics behind neural networks. This involved implementing a simple neural network architecture and algorithms for forward propagation, backpropagation, and training (using the gradient descent algorithm).
