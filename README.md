## Regression Neural Network from Scratch (July 2024)

I constructed a neural network for linear regression to noisy, synthetic data. Since I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of neural networks, I implemented a neural network and associated training framework (backpropagation and gradient descent) using only Numpy. Whilst the neural network is able to learn the relationship quite well, it overfits quite easily and sometimes converges to local minima (an inherent disadvantage of the gradient descent algorithm).
